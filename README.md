# HTML Demo
Demonstration of HTML and CSS reporting in a C# application. 
Example code for use by students. 

### Project Introduction
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate creating an HTML file that can be used to display reports,
receipts, and other types of similar output in a highly portable light weight manner. 

This is not an exhaustive demonstration of HTML or CSS nor is it a complete solution for any project.
